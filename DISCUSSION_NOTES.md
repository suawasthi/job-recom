## Algorithm Analysis

### Rule-Based Nature
The current job recommendation algorithm is purely rule-based with the following characteristics:

#### Hard-coded Scoring Rules:
1. **Skill Matching** (40% weight):
   - Direct match: 1.0 score
   - NLP-extracted match: 0.8 score
   - Ontology-based match: 0.6 score
   - Category-based match: 0.4 score
   - Required skills: 80% weight
   - Preferred skills: 20% weight

2. **Experience Matching** (25% weight):
   - Exact match: 1.0 score
   - Under-experienced: 0.2 penalty
   - Over-experienced: 0.1 penalty

3. **Location Matching** (20% weight):
   - Remote/Exact match: 1.0 score
   - City match: 0.9 score
   - State match: 0.6 score
   - Hybrid: 0.7 score

4. **Salary Matching** (15% weight):
   - Within/below range: 1.0 score
   - Above range: Penalty applied

#### Static Weight Distribution:
- Skills: 40%
- Experience: 25%
- Location: 20%
- Salary: 15%

#### Deterministic Decision Making:
- Fixed thresholds for match reasons
- No learning from user behavior
- No personalization based on historical data

##  Mathematical Model of Current Job Matching Weights

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's the comprehensive mathematical model of the current job matching system:

### **1. Overall Match Score Formula**

The final job match score is calculated as:

```
Overall_Score = Σ(Feature_Score_i × Weight_i) + Market_Adjustments
```

Where:
```
Overall_Score = skill_score × w_skill + 
                experience_score × w_experience + 
                location_score × w_location + 
                semantic_score × w_semantic + 
                salary_score × w_salary + 
                0.5 × w_market_demand + 
                0.5 × w_career_growth
```

### **2. Base Weights (Default Configuration)**

```
w_skill = 0.35          (35%)
w_experience = 0.25     (25%) 
w_location = 0.15       (15%)
w_salary = 0.10         (10%)
w_semantic = 0.10       (10%)
w_market_demand = 0.03  (3%)
w_career_growth = 0.02  (2%)
```

**Total: 100%**

### **3. Industry-Specific Weight Adjustments**

#### **Technology Industry:**
```
w_skill = 0.45          (45% - Skills are crucial)
w_experience = 0.20     (20% - Experience matters but skills more)
w_location = 0.10       (10% - Remote work common)
w_salary = 0.10         (10% - Competitive salaries)
w_semantic = 0.10       (10% - Job description alignment)
w_market_demand = 0.03  (3%)
w_career_growth = 0.02  (2%)
```

#### **Finance Industry:**
```
w_skill = 0.25          (25% - Skills important but not primary)
w_experience = 0.35     (35% - Experience is crucial)
w_location = 0.20       (20% - Location matters for finance)
w_salary = 0.15         (15% - High salary expectations)
w_semantic = 0.03       (3% - Less emphasis on description)
w_market_demand = 0.01  (1%)
w_career_growth = 0.01  (1%)
```

#### **Healthcare Industry:**
```
w_skill = 0.20          (20% - Technical skills less important)
w_experience = 0.40     (40% - Experience and credentials crucial)
w_location = 0.25       (25% - Location very important)
w_salary = 0.10         (10% - Stable but not highest)
w_semantic = 0.03       (3% - Less emphasis on description)
w_market_demand = 0.01  (1%)
w_career_growth = 0.01  (1%)
```

### **4. Career Stage Multipliers**

#### **Entry Level (0-1 years):**
```
skill_weight × 1.5      (Skills more important)
experience_weight × 0.3 (Experience less important)
location_weight × 1.2   (Location flexibility important)
salary_weight × 0.8     (Salary less critical)
semantic_weight × 1.3   (Job description alignment important)
```

#### **Senior Level (7-12 years):**
```
skill_weight × 0.8      (Skills less critical)
experience_weight × 1.3 (Experience more important)
location_weight × 0.9   (Location flexibility)
salary_weight × 1.2     (Salary more important)
semantic_weight × 0.9   (Less emphasis on description)
```

#### **Executive Level (12+ years):**
```
skill_weight × 0.4      (Strategic thinking over technical)
experience_weight × 1.8 (Extensive experience required)
location_weight × 0.7   (Global roles)
salary_weight × 1.5     (Executive compensation)
semantic_weight × 0.7   (Vision alignment)
```

### **5. Skill Matching Sub-Model**

Within the skill score calculation:

```
skill_score = (required_match_ratio × 0.8) + (preferred_match_ratio × 0.2)
```

Where:
```
required_match_ratio = matched_required_skills / total_required_skills
preferred_match_ratio = matched_preferred_skills / total_preferred_skills
```

### **6. Dynamic Weight Calculation Process**

```
1. Start with industry-specific base weights
2. Apply career stage multipliers
3. Apply user preference adjustments
4. Apply market condition adjustments  
5. Normalize to ensure weights sum to 1.0
```

### **7. Market Condition Adjustments**

```
if remote_work_trend > 0.6:
    location_weight ×= (1.0 - remote_trend × 0.3)

if skill_shortage > 0.6:
    skill_weight ×= (1.0 + skill_shortage × 0.2)

if economic_uncertainty > 0.6:
    salary_weight ×= 0.8
```

### **8. User Preference Adjustments**

```
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

### **9. Example Calculation**

For a **Technology Senior Developer** (7 years experience):

**Base Technology Weights:**
- skill_weight = 0.45
- experience_weight = 0.20
- location_weight = 0.10
- salary_weight = 0.10
- semantic_weight = 0.10

**Senior Level Adjustments:**
- skill_weight = 0.45 × 0.8 = 0.36
- experience_weight = 0.20 × 1.3 = 0.26
- location_weight = 0.10 × 0.9 = 0.09
- salary_weight = 0.10 × 1.2 = 0.12
- semantic_weight = 0.10 × 0.9 = 0.09

**Final Normalized Weights:**
- skill_weight = 0.36 / 0.92 = 0.391 (39.1%)
- experience_weight = 0.26 / 0.92 = 0.283 (28.3%)
- location_weight = 0.09 / 0.92 = 0.098 (9.8%)
- salary_weight = 0.12 / 0.92 = 0.130 (13.0%)
- semantic_weight = 0.09 / 0.92 = 0.098 (9.8%)

### **10. Key Insights**

1. **Skills are most important** in technology roles (up to 45%)
2. **Experience becomes more critical** at senior levels
3. **Location importance decreases** with remote work trends
4. **Salary importance increases** with career progression
5. **The system adapts dynamically** based on industry, career stage, and market conditions

This mathematical model shows a sophisticated, context-aware weighting system that adjusts based on multiple factors to provide optimal job matching scores.
